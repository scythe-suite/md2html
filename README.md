# md2html

A tool to convert Markdown documents (possibly including external images) to
self-contained HTML with GItHub CSS. This is just an hack based on:

* [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/),
* [b64](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/b64/) from [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/), and
* [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css).
